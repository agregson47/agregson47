- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @agregson47 - Andrew
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding in python, C/C++, ARM, x64 and retro coding in z80, 6502, 68k, BASIC and Forth. "Close to metal" rPI and rPI PICO.
- I enjoy lower level graphics, sound and games often writing as much as possible myself.
- I miss the days when my hobby was called programming and it was fun and spontaneous.
