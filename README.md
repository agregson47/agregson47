- 👋 Hi, I’m @agregson47
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in python, C/C++, ARM, x64 and retro coding in z80, 6502, 68k, BASIC and Forth. Bare metal Arduino, rPI PICO, STM32, ESP8266/32
- 🌱 I’m currently learning latest changes to python3, jupyter
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on modern retro themed projects - emulations, "fantasy consoles", retro/bare metal coding in browser
